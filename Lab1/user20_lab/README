To compile and run our code:
1. Run the `matrixgen` executable (not included) to produce input matrices of size `n * n`.
2. Run `make` to compile our lab code.
3. Run `./main p`, where `p` is the number of threads.
  - As per the lab manual, `p` must be a perfect square number and must perfectly divide `n * n` (where `n` is the side length of each matrix).
