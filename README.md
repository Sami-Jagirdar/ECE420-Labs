# ECE420-Labs

- have a local clone of our [repo](https://github.com/Sami-Jagirdar/ECE420-Labs/blob/main/get_and_commit.sh)
- after making some changes on VM,
  1. update the `exclude_files.txt` in your local repo the same way you would update a `.gitignore` (i.e. add any executables/venvs/etc that don't need to be saved)
  2. run `source get_and_commit.sh "your commit message here"` to download everything from the VM, stage, commmit, and push it
